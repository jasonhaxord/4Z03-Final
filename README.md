# Gait Analysis

Tony said "i'll worry about this later" so leaving the readme blank

Tony will never get around to changing this file so a checklist will be added.

Tony's TODO:

- [ ] edit readme.md
- [ ] implement audio playback

Alan's TODO:
- [ ] 2 sensor peak detection 
- [ ] 2 sensor gait rhythm
